Today, I practiced essential Linux terminal commands to navigate the file system, manage files and directories, handle permissions, and monitor the system. Below are the commands I performed along with their purposes and usage:

ls – I used this to list the contents of the current directory.

cd /var/log – Changed the directory to /var/log to explore system logs.

pwd – Checked my current directory path to confirm location.

mkdir test_dir – Created a new directory named test_dir.

rmdir test_dir – Removed the empty directory test_dir.

touch file.txt – Created a new empty file named file.txt.

rm file.txt – Deleted the file.txt file I created earlier.

cp file.txt /tmp/ – Copied file.txt to the /tmp/ directory.

mv file.txt backup.txt – Renamed file.txt to backup.txt.

man ls – Opened the manual page to learn about the ls command and its options.

echo "Hello World" – Printed the message “Hello World” on the terminal.

chmod 755 script.sh – Changed permissions of the file script.sh to make it executable.

chown user:user file.txt – Changed the ownership of file.txt to a specific user.

ps aux – Listed all active processes running on the system.

kill 1234 – Terminated the process with PID 1234 (used sample PID).

top – Viewed real-time system processes and resource usage.

df -h – Checked the disk space usage in a human-readable format.

du -sh /etc/ – Displayed the total size of the /etc/ directory.

cat file.txt – Viewed the contents of file.txt directly on the terminal.

nano file.txt – Edited the file.txt using the nano terminal-based editor.

clear – Cleared the terminal screen to remove clutter.

exit – Logged out from the terminal session.

These commands helped me gain practical confidence in working with the Linux command-line environment—an essential skill in cybersecurity operations.
